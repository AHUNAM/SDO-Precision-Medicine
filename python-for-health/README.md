# Overview
This folder documents my practical experience applying Python to healthcare, inspired by my training at Standard Data Ocean. It explores how state-of-the-art techniques can be used to solve real-world health challenges.

## Keyboard Shortcut
- Press `shift` + `enter` if you want to run your written program
- Press `A` if you want to add a cell above the current cell you are working on
- Press `B` if you want to add a cell below the current cell you are working on 
- Select the cell + `M` to change a code cell to markdown cell, 
- Press `D` two times to delete any cell 
- Press `H` if you want help with more shortcuts
Note: You must be in command mode for shortcuts like A, B, M, and D to work â€” that means the cell is not actively being edited (you'll see a blue border, not green).

ðŸ’¡ How to enter command mode
Press Esc while in a cell. Youâ€™ll see the border turn blue.
Now your keyboard shortcuts like A, B, M, and D will work.
