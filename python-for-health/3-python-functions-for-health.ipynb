    "We’ve been hearing it everywhere — functions, functions, functions! But wait, what exactly is a function? Like, let’s not rush. In simple, everyday talk — what does it really mean when you say something has a function? It means it has a job! It does something. It’s useful. It’s not just sitting there looking pretty. Now, bring that same energy to Python functions. In Python, when we say function, we mean: “A reusable block of code that does something automatically when you call it — without writing it all over again.” Yep! You create it once, and anytime you call its name — it will run the exact instructions you gave it, like a loyal assistant. It’s like saving a shortcut for tasks you know you’ll do more than once.\n",
